                        Uses variations of moves with roses, such as Royal Devil Roses. His idea is that only a supreme power can maintain peace and order in the world, even if that
                        power comes from evil. Therefore, even though he was aware that the Grand Master served evil, he ended up obeying his orders and killing Daidalos, Shun's master. 
                        His attitude may not be the most exemplary for a Knight, but his purpose to keep the peace on Earth is equal to that of any Knight.</div>
